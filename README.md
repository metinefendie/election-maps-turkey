# Precinct-Level Election Results of Turkey

This package aims to collect and share official election results of Turkey. I hope this initiative can fuel academic studies on political elections of Turkey. I am going to update the official results from presidential, legislative, municipal elections held by Supreme Election Council of Turkey [Yüksek Seçim Kurulu, YSK].

I am collecting election results data from YSK's official website (https://sonuc.ysk.gov.tr). So far, I scraped the results for June 2018 and November 2015 legislative elections for each district (mahalle) and ballot box (sandık no). I will add results from June 2015 (legislative), March 2019 (municipal), and June 2018 (presidential) pretty soon.
